# Flask Docker App 🚀

This is a beginner-friendly project where I created a simple Python Flask web application and ran it inside a Docker container.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of Flask (a Python web framework)
- Writing a `Dockerfile`
- Building and running Docker containers
- Using `docker build` and `docker run` commands
- Pushing code to GitHub
